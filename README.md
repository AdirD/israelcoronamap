# Coronavirus Notifier
A mobile app to update you about whether you've been near someone that has Coronavirus.

Data about where people with Coronavirus have been is given by the Ministry of Health.
User data about user's location at specific times is stored locally on device.
The app then sees if there's a match between the user's whereabouts and the data from the Ministry of Health.

## Step 1
Website where the user actively presses a button to store current location.

## Step 2
Mobile app that stores users location continuously.

## Current status
We've implemented step 1. If you want to help with step 2, please feel free. If can be any of:
* Native Android and iOS
* Flutter
* React native
* Some other idea :-)

Code can be reused or completely rewritten. It's fine.
